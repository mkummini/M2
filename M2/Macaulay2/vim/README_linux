These are files useful for running M2 inside vim on a GNU/Linux machine. 
These use the scripts by David Cook II (earlier available at
http://www.ms.uky.edu/~dcook/files/Macaulay2.vim).

I. Required programmes

    1. xterm 
    2. screen
    3. vim

II. Files included 

    0. README_linux  (this file)
    
    1. m2.vim.dict (vim dictionary file, used for completion and
spell-check)

    2. m2.vim.syntax (instructions on how the various types of words are to
be highlighted)

    3. m2.vim.ftplugin_linux (the main file that implements how M2
commands from the vim window is transferred to M2 running inside a
screen session)

III. Usage

    1. Add the following line to $HOME/.vimrc, to set the filetype

        au BufNewFile,BufRead *.m2 set filetype=m2

    2. Ensure that syntax highlighting is enabled and filetype plugins
    are read by adding the following lines to $HOME/.vimrc
    
        syntax enable
        filetype plugin indent on

    2. copy m2.vim.dict as $HOME/.vim/dict/m2.vim.dict 

    3. copy m2.vim.syntax as $HOME/.vim/syntax/m2.vim, without the .syntax
at the end. 

    4. copy m2.vim.ftplugin_linux as $HOME/.vim/ftplugin/m2.vim
